📊 Data Analyst | Data-Driven Engineer | R Programming  

Data-driven engineer with strong academic and professional experience in **data analysis and visualization**. I hold an **M.Sc. in Water Management Engineering** from **Szent István University (Central Europe)** and an **M.Eng. in Biosystems Engineering** from the **University of Manitoba, Canada**.

Previously, I worked as an **Energy Analyst at Schneider Electric**, where I analyzed large-scale energy datasets to support performance monitoring and data-driven decision-making.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have worked extensively with **large datasets**, focusing on **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualization**. I am particularly interested in applying analytics to **energy, water resources, and sustainability-related problems**.
